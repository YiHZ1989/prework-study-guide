# <Education organization student guide>

## Description
I would like to develop a webpage can assist student navigating their study journey, make it easier for them to find the right team for the service they need, and also make student services (ie. letter issuing) and academic services (ie. check current study status) easier.
I would like to build this project as currently for education organiszation staffs admin tasks takes a lot of time, while if there's an accessible and reliable source of information it can save a lot of time for staff. 
This project not only can increase Education organization staffs' productivity, it can eventually reduce the staff number, and reduce the operation cost.
